# telescope_coverage



band around equator of some degrees
+- 15 degrees relative to equator (configurable)

~35786km
- confirm this
- relative to center

up to 15 degree to horizon

define volume telescope can see

geostationary orbit

multiple belts, eventually

200 km^2





set of solutions such that overlap is minimized (less than some amount)
